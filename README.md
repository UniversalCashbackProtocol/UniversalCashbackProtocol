⚠️NOTE: the actual account of the Universal Cashback Protocol repositories was created on **22/11/2021**, the code before this date lived in the accounts of the initial participants; This last change was encouraged by wanting to make the solution to the problem we raised in its entirety a reality, appropriating it would not allow it, sharing it to the world is the best option, this will be a reality not a fantasy, ¡we will achieve it!
