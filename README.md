## Universal Cashback Protocol

**What is the Universal Cashback Protocol?
**

It is a protocol for affiliated companies that want to carry out promotions in order to get customers loyalty. It works as follows: for the purchase of products, users receive Tokens (a.k.a. UCP Protocol Tokens) that they can then use to exchange for products at any company that uses the Protocol.


**General objectives:
**

•	Promote the inclusion of people without technical knowledge in the Crypto economy through granting Cashback benefits in a simple way.
 
•	Adopt Blockchain technology in everyday use cases.
 
•	Expose to the general population the benefits and options obtained from decentralization.


**What does this project contribute to the community?
 **
 
We believe that everyone wins: The idea is that more people can approach the ecosystem of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies in a more friendly way. And all people make purchases of different products on a daily basis.
Consumers: they will be happy to make a profit on their purchases.
Companies: we provide the tools for a simple cashback process avoiding bureaucracy and technical knowledge.
